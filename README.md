# PitchMastVR
An experimental project that allows users to virtual present 2D presentations in a 3D space

# Hey There!
This project is very much in development, and its code might be a little rough around the edges. What turned out to be a small experiment exploded into the possibility of reworking and rethinking how we pitch/share idea with other people.

#### Currently, users can:
- Browse their directories in VR space
- Select a PDF on their PC, and convert this PDF into a 2D presentation n VR space
- Draw on slides and in 3D space


#### Features I am working towards building:
- Create text via voice speech
- Import Poly models
- Create animations fro text/models
- Host a presentation, and invite friends/family into the VR space
